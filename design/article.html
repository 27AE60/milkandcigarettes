				Software design is a process by which the software requirements are translated
		into a representation of software components, interfaces, and data necessary for
		the implementation phase. The SDD shows how the software system will be
		structured to satisfy the requirements. It is the primary reference for code
		development and, therefore, it must contain all the information required by a
		programmer to write code. The SDD is performed in two stages. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The first is a preliminary design in which the overall system architecture and data architecture
		is defined. In the second stage, i.e. the detailed design stage, more detailed data
		structures are defined and algorithms are developed for the defined architecture.
