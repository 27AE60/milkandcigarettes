		<h1>Our secret ingredients (Design Principles)</h1>
		<blockquote>...There is no secret recipe. We focus in understanding the process...</blockquote>

    <p>Any design for a website, should be able to convey information. Colors selection, white space precision, typography is an important aspect of UX and UI. It makes us want to explore more. However, if you are seeking for a good loyal user base, I feel website should be designed around the content.</p>

    <p>Following principles guide us in our venture for a good design.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Information Architecture</b></li>
      <li><b>McDonald's Theory</b></li>
      <li><b>Inspiration</b></li>
      <li><b>Scenarios</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
    <p><i>A well-established theory that drives the design of structures for websites.</i></p>
		<p>First step is to identify content of website, common structures and get overall idea of the flow of website.</p>
		<p><b>Tools we use for this step:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>card sorting:</b><i> to organize content based on hierarchy</i></li>
      <li><b>content inventories:</b><i> to understand breadth of your website and the purpose of the page</i></li>
      <li><b>paper and sketch boards:</b><i> to quickly and collaboratively sketch out a website architecture</i></li>
      <li><b>site map designs:</b><i> visually explain the relationships between pages on our website</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>McDonald's Theory</h3>
    <p>McDonald's Theory derives its inspiration from an article on McDonald's Theory by Jon Bell in <a href="https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d">medium</a>.</p>
    <p><b>McDonaldâ€™s Theory:</b> <i>People are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.</i></p>
    <p>Therefore, we start with a minimal bad design. After following Information Architecture, we get an overview of content structures. So, first of all we start adding the content to the layout(based on priority). Then designing it and iterating this process until we are convinced with the first draft.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Once we have our first draft, it is better to see how it is implemented in some other website. In this manner, we not only validate our reasoning as why a particular content is presented in such a manner, but also are able to find our own mistakes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://patterntap.com/">patterntap.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/">dribbile.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mobile-patterns.com/">mobile-patterns.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.behance.com">behance.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <p>This step is more focused on where the design is mostly applicable and for whom. We discuss questions like, Should we go with icons, text, labels? Is the message clear for our target user?. Actually, we do follow this step in the beginning and also towards the end of each design iterations.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, what I understand is, there are no hard and fast rules for a good design. It is an interactive process. We are in love with the first design draft. Gradually, we end up with altogether different design which conveys most of the information.</p>
