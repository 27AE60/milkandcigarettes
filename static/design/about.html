		<h1>About 27AE60</h1>

    <p>Some of us meditates, floating in between dreams and hopes. Some of us enjoy each moment we aspire. Some of us wonders
    the serenity behind each design. Some of us are just into the wild. Though bothersome, together we create moments to cherish
    for the whole life. We are brothers in arms. We are 27AE60 ! </p>

    <p>It is a fairy tale. I mean, who else has a Magical cupboard. People say it is a portal. But we are more or less happy to see our wishes get fulfilled. We have a Talking Glass. We scribble all our ideas on it. It is shrewd enough to narrate out ‘Philosophy and Principles’ of each idea pondered on it. We have ‘Teachers’ to guide us through our journey. Our ability is adding magic to little things we care.</p>

    <p>To tell you the truth, we feel most of us knowingly or unknowingly are a part of  ‘Vicious Cycle’. If we are not happy with what we are doing, we are part of it. We share our ideas, thoughts and memories. Our motivation to build something useful for everyone is our way to break free from the cycle. The magic is, ‘We’. </p>
