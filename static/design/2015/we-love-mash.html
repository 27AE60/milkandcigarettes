    <h1>We love M*A*S*H.</h1>
    <p>Lately, me, babaji and mojo jojo, we spend our lunch, dinner and tea watching this amazing
    American series called M*A*S*H. It's adapted from the 1970 feature film MASH
    (which was itself based on 1968 novel MASH by Richard Hooker). Richard Hooker is also a surgeon.
    So, basically, MASH is based on his experiences during the Korean War. (source: wikipedia)
    I'm wondering whether Alan Alda is a portrayal of Richard Hooker?
    Hence, MASH movie is officially on my wish-list. </p>

    <p>I've always loved the conversation, the dialogue, how well each character is portrayed by
    genius actors. Like, this one, a sweet prayer before meals (in Radar's family): </p>

    <blockquote>Thank you for the world so sweet, <br />
    thank you for the food we eat, <br/>
    Thank you for the birds that sing,
    thank you, God, for everything.</blockquote>

    <p>This show aired on network primetime while the Vietnam War was still ongoing. So, basically,
    MASH series has all the sarcasms, comradeship, feeling of loneliness which is delicately portrayed in a
    comic manner. I do get this message that either war gets the best of you or the best in you. </p>

    <p>We, totally adore this series and is a must recommendation for everyone reading this post. </p>

    <p>P. S - This is our favorite lines from the series, </p>

    <blockquote>Be it ever so crumbled, there is no place like home.</blockquote>

    <p>And, these are some awesome googled quotes from this series: </p>

    <blockquote>Here's a mover and a groover and it ain't by Herbert Hoover.
    It's for all you animals and music lovers. -- Radar as a camp DJ.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Attention. Major Houlihan, your chest x-rays are ready and they really came out beautiful. -- PA System</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice, pull down your pants and slide on the ice. -- Sidney Freedman</blockquote>

    <blockquote>This is Frank Burns, one of our best surgeons. A real killer. -- Henry</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Don't worry, I've never lost a patient. I never lose anything. Have you seen my stethoscope? -- Hawkeye</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Look, all I know is what they taught me at command school.<br />
    There are certain rules about a war and rule number one is young men die.
    And rule number two is doctors can't change rule number one. - Henry </blockquote>
