		<h1>My First Step to Get Out of the Vicious Cycle</h1>
		<blockquote>...And This is how it begins...</blockquote>
		<p>I came back from office and went into kitchen to see what my friends were up to.</p>
		<p><b>Babaji:</b> Hey Raka did you know that we took a domain. It is called milkandcigarettes dot so. See it's like milk and cigarettes dot so ...hahahahaha</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> milkandcigarettes?</p>
		<p><b>Ghome:</b> why did you tell him? It was supposed to be a surprise.</p>
		<p><b>Justass and Babaji:</b> See it's like we wake up every day and the first thing we think of is milk for tea and cigarettes.
		<i>That's how milkandcigarettes.so was started.</i> They told me everything about the project. From deployment, architecture and how to take it forward.</p>
		<p>After few days, I asked Justass lets make design and write html, css and make it live.</p>

		<p>"This was the design which he made in the beginning." </p>
		<p>
			And now it was my turn to build and told Justass I will do it. But after few days I forgot and on Tuesday evening he asked hey did you do that? I was like what? The milkandcigarettes. Oh that I will complete it today.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was busy all the day and I almost forgot whole thing. I was fully tired due to working full day in the office. While I was returning back from the office I thought I will complete this milk and cigarettes in Cab. So I boarded the cab and started writing the code. I completed the page and slept in the cab.
		</p>
		<p>
			After reaching home I showed to Justass and told him I did this in the cab today. Everyone was amazed.
		</p>
		<p>
			On Saturday we decided to make it live as we discussed let us not put some dummy article. And told me to write how I completed my task, write about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's it guys see you in next article.

		</p>
		<p>Till Then</p>
